# Learning

This Repository is for us to start a Project Together and learn it's different aspects.

- We will be using Kotlin/Java for most of our work and will use Spring Boot or Webflux as our main Frameworks.
- We will also use different Databases like Sql, Mongo, Redis etc.
- We will learn about APIs and Layering using this Project
- We will also Learn about Async Communication using Kafka and Coroutines or some other Messaging Queues.
- We will embed AWS for some usecases
- At then we'll deploy this on some server to run it forever and keep on managing it.

Also Feel free to edit/Update the Readme and try to Keep the CODE Clean. 
Thanks :)
